# **UTDF: AUTH-01-SECURITY-REVIEW - Complete Missing Security Audit**

## **1. Agent Assignment**

- **Primary Agent:** `Security_Auditor`

## **2. Task Description**

The original AUTH-01-BE-REVIEW task was marked complete but NO security review report was delivered. Perform a comprehensive security audit of the Google OAuth callback endpoint implementation, focusing on token validation, data exposure, and authentication flow security.

## **3. Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] **VERIFY** Google ID token is validated using official Google libraries (not just decoded)
- [ ] **CHECK** that no sensitive data (passwords, internal tokens) appears in error messages
- [ ] **CONFIRM** backend-issued JWT contains only necessary claims (`userId`, `email`)
- [ ] **VALIDATE** that Google token verification includes audience and issuer checks
- [ ] **REVIEW** rate limiting is properly applied to authentication endpoints
- [ ] **ENSURE** user creation/update logic prevents injection attacks
- [ ] **ASSESS** session management and token storage security

## **4. Relevant Files & Context**

- `backend/app/main.py` (the `/auth/google/callback` endpoint)
- `backend/app/core/auth.py` (contains `verify_google_id_token` and JWT functions)
- `backend/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (project security standards)
- `backend/app/data/local_db.py` (user creation logic)

## **5. Required Output Format**

- **Format:** A structured security audit report
- **Structure:**
