### Frontend Project Status Handover

**To the Next AI Agent:**

This document summarizes the current state of the `retriever-study/frontend` application, outlining the work completed, the features currently working, and the critical next steps.

---

#### 1. Overall Goals & Specifics

*   **Overall Project Goal:** To deliver an AI-powered study group finder application, production-ready within a week.
*   **Frontend Role:** To build the user interface, integrate with the backend APIs, and ensure a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.
*   **Frontend Tech Stack:** React (v18), React Router (v6), `react-scripts` (Create React App).
*   **Design Language:** Zara-inspired minimalist aesthetic (white backgrounds, black text, all-caps typography, spacious layouts).
*   **Key Libraries Integrated:**
    *   `@react-oauth/google`: For Google OAuth 2.0 login.
    *   `jwt-decode`: For decoding JWTs on the frontend.
    *   `socket.io-client`: For real-time WebSocket communication.

---

#### 2. Features Currently Working (Implemented by this Agent)

The frontend now has the foundational elements and core pages integrated with live data:

*   **Authentication System:**
    *   **Google OAuth Login/Logout Flow:** Users can initiate Google login, and the frontend captures the Google-issued JWT.
    *   **Session Persistence:** User login status and token are persisted across page refreshes using `localStorage`.
    *   **Protected Routes:** Routes like `/profile`, `/recommendations`, and `/group/:groupId` are guarded, automatically redirecting unauthenticated users to the `/login` page.
    *   **Dynamic Header:** The header dynamically displays "HELLO, [User's Name]" and a "LOG OUT" button when authenticated, and "LOG IN" when not.
*   **Core Page Integrations:**
    *   **`GroupsList.js`:** Now uses the real logged-in user's ID (from `AuthContext`) to fetch personalized recommendations.
    *   **`Profile.js`:**
        *   Displays the real logged-in user's name and email.
        *   Fetches and displays the user's actual joined groups from the backend.
        *   The "Edit Profile" functionality for the user's `bio` is connected to the `updateUser` API.
    *   **`GroupDetail.js`:**
        *   Fetches and displays real group details (name, description, members) based on the URL `groupId`.
        *   Fetches and displays historical chat messages for the group.
        *   **Real-time Chat:** Fully implemented using WebSockets (`socket.io-client`). Messages are sent and received via WebSocket.
        *   "Join Group" button is connected to the `joinGroup` API.

#### 3. Needs to be Worked On for the Next AI Agent (Frontend - Remaining Tasks)

The following tasks are critical for moving the frontend towards production readiness and completing the remaining features.

**A. CRITICAL: Backend Authentication Integration (Highest Priority)**

*   **Problem:** Currently, the frontend uses the Google-issued JWT directly for authentication with *our* backend. This is **not secure or scalable** for production. Our backend needs to verify the Google token and issue its *own* application-specific JWT.
*   **Task:**
    1.  Modify `frontend/src/pages/Login.js` (`handleLoginSuccess` function).
    2.  After receiving the `credentialResponse.credential` (Google's JWT), send this token to a new backend endpoint (e.g., `/auth/google-login`).
    3.  The backend should verify this Google token, create/retrieve the user in its database, and return its *own* JWT.
    4.  The frontend must then store and use this **backend-issued JWT** for all subsequent authenticated API calls (via `localStorage` and `api.js`).

**B. Profile Page Enhancements:**

*   **Task:** Implement full "Edit Profile" functionality for `courses` and `prefs` (study style, time slots, locations). Currently, only `bio` is editable. This will involve updating `Profile.js` and potentially adding new API calls to `api.js` if the backend doesn't support these fields in `updateUser`.

**C. Group Detail Page Enhancements:**

*   **Task:** Implement the "Summarize Chat" feature. The frontend button exists, but the `summarizeChat` API call needs to be fully wired up and tested with the backend.
*   **Task:** Display sender's full name in chat messages. Currently, it uses `user.name` for the current user and `User XXX` for others. The backend needs to provide `senderName` in the message object.
*   **Task:** Implement "Member List Display" (from `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`).

**D. Remaining Core Pages:**

*   **Task:** Complete "Create new user functionality" on the `Login.js` page (from `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`).

**E. General Frontend Enhancements & Deployment Preparation:**

*   **Task:** Implement "Push notifications for new messages" (from 7-day plan).
*   **Task:** Conduct "Mobile-responsive design testing and fixes" across the entire application.
*   **Task:** Perform "End-to-end testing with real Google OAuth" (once backend auth is complete).
*   **Task:** Implement "User analytics setup."
*   **Task:** Provide instructions for "S3 + CloudFront CDN setup" (the `build` folder is ready for upload).

**Next Agent's Focus:** The most critical next step for the frontend is to work closely with the backend agent to implement the **Backend Authentication Integration (Section A)**. This is foundational for the security and proper functioning of the entire application.
